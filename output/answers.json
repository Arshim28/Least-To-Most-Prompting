Josh bought the house for $80,000. \n2. The total cost of repairs was $50,000. \n3. The value of the house increased by 150%, which means it increased by 150% of its original value. \n   150% of $80,000 = $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000\n4. To calculate the profit, we subtract the total cost from the increased value: \n   Profit = $120,000 - ($80,000 + $50,000) = $120,000 - $130,000 = -$10,000\nFinal Answer: Josh made a loss of $10,000."

    "completion": "1. How many cups of feed does Wendi give her chickens in total? 2. How many cups of feed does Wendi need to give her chickens in the final meal of the day?\n\n1. In the morning, Wendi gives her flock of chickens 15 cups of feed. \n2. In the afternoon, she gives her chickens another 25 cups of feed. \n3. So far, Wendi has given her chickens 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.\n4. Since Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day, she needs to give her chickens 20 x 3 = 60 cups of feed in total.\n5. Therefore, in the final meal of the day, Wendi needs to give her chickens 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed.\n\nFinal Answer: Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."

    "completion": "1. How many vacuum cleaners did Melanie start with? 2. How many vacuum cleaners did Melanie sell in total?\n1. Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left.\n2. Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, 2 more to the red house, and half of what was left at the orange house. This means she sold (1/3) + 2 + (1/2) = 7/6 of her vacuum cleaners.\nTo find the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, we can set up the equation: 7/6 * total number of vacuum cleaners = total number of vacuum cleaners - 5.\nSimplifying the equation, we have: 7/6 * total number of vacuum cleaners = 1/6 * total number of vacuum cleaners + 5.\nMultiplying both sides of the equation by 6, we have: 7 * total number of vacuum cleaners = total number of vacuum cleaners + 30.\nSubtracting total number of vacuum cleaners from both sides of the equation, we have: 6 * total number of vacuum cleaners = 30.\nDividing both sides of the equation by 6, we have: total number of vacuum cleaners = 30 / 6 = 5.\nFinal Answer: Melanie started with 5 vacuum cleaners."
